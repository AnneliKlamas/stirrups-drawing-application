For running frontend the backend solution should be running and have the imported data. The data can be found in the file imports.txt. For importing data to the dataset go to http://localhost:8080/h2-console click “Connect”, copy paste the content of the imports.txt to the SQL statements field. To enter settings it is needed to use username "AnneliK" and password "Klamas1234".
